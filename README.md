# Varun Singh ðŸ‘‹

**Aspiring Data Analyst & AI Engineer**

I build practical, data-driven and ML-enabled projects focused on data cleaning, model development, evaluation, and clear reproducible analysis. My repositories include notebooks, evaluation metrics, and short demos that highlight model behavior and limitations.

---

## Summary

* Practical experience in end-to-end data workflows: exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and reproducibility.
* Emphasis on clear documentation, model transparency (model cards / evaluation), and reproducible notebooks that reviewers can run and inspect.

## Skills & Technologies

**Data & ML**

* Python Â· pandas Â· NumPy Â· scikit-learn Â· XGBoost Â· Prophet Â· basic PyTorch
* SQL (analysis & joins) Â· exploratory data analysis (EDA) Â· feature engineering
* Model evaluation: cross-validation, RMSE/MAE, precision/recall, ROC/PR curves

**MLOps & Reproducibility**

* Experiment tracking concepts, reproducible notebooks, scripted data pipelines, and lightweight reproducibility instructions (one-command notebooks / `requirements.txt`).

**Tools**

* Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Colab

## Resume-ready bullets

* **Churn Analysis & Prediction:** Performed EDA and built a logistic regression churn model on the Telco Customer Churn dataset; reported ROC AUC â‰ˆ 0.83, produced business KPIs and three actionable retention strategies in `ChurnAnalysis.pdf`.
* **RFM Analysis & Product Prioritization:** Conducted RFM segmentation on the Online Retail dataset to identify high-value customer segments; produced forecasting-ready insights, revenue trend visualizations, and prioritized products for promotion.

## Contact

* **Demo GIFs**: short 30â€“60s GIFs for key flows are included in each repo for a quick glance.
* **Notebooks**: every ML project includes an EDA notebook and a model evaluation notebook.
* **How to run**: each project has a simple `requirements.txt` and a short `README` section with steps to reproduce core notebooks.

## Resume-ready bullets

* **AI Meeting Summarizer:** Processed transcripts and evaluated multiple LLM prompt strategies; implemented ROUGE-based evaluation and published reproducible notebooks documenting model behavior and failure modes.
* **Personal Finance Visualizer:** Built forecasting and anomaly-detection pipelines for transactional data; compared models (Prophet/XGBoost) and provided visual explanations for forecast and anomaly outputs.
* **Cashflow Core:** Implemented a minimal-settlement algorithm with integer-cent precision and comprehensive unit tests; validated correctness across multiple edge-case scenarios.

If you want, I can now:

* Create concise 3-bullet TL;DR headers for each repo README (data-focused), or
* Draft 30s demo scripts and GIF checklists for the two priority projects (Meeting Summarizer, Finance Visualizer).
