# **Aspiring Data Analyst & AI Engineer**


I build practical, data-driven and ML-enabled projects focused on data cleaning, model development, evaluation, and clear reproducible analysis. My repositories include notebooks, evaluation metrics, and short demos that highlight model behavior and limitations.

---

## Summary

* Practical experience in end-to-end data workflows: exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and reproducibility.
* Emphasis on clear documentation, model transparency (model cards / evaluation), and reproducible notebooks that reviewers can run and inspect.

## Skills & Technologies

**Data & ML**

* Python · pandas · NumPy · scikit-learn · basic PyTorch
* SQL (analysis & joins) · exploratory data analysis (EDA) · feature engineering
* Model evaluation: cross-validation, RMSE/MAE, precision/recall, ROC/PR curves

**Tools**

* Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Colab

## Key Projects

* **Churn Analysis & Prediction:** Performed EDA and built a logistic regression churn model on the Telco Customer Churn dataset; reported ROC AUC ≈ 0.83, produced business KPIs and three actionable retention strategies in `ChurnAnalysis.pdf`.
* **RFM Analysis & Product Prioritization:** Conducted RFM segmentation on the Online Retail dataset to identify high-value customer segments; produced forecasting-ready insights, revenue trend visualizations, and prioritized products for promotion.

---

* **Notebooks**: every ML project includes an EDA notebook and a model evaluation notebook.
* **How to run**: each project has a simple and a short `README` section with steps to reproduce core notebooks.
